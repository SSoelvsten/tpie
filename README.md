The TPIE (Templated Portable I/O Environment) library is a tool box providing
efficient and convenient tools to ease the implementation of algorithms and data
structures on very large sets of data.

Project status, Releases and stability
======================================

As of 2021, this project does not see much development, but it is used heavily in production.
There has not been a TPIE release for a long time, but the master branch is very stable and is unlikely to see major breaking changes.
