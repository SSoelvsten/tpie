/**
\page file_stream Reading and writing file streams

The central class in TPIE for reading from files and writing to files is the
\ref tpie::file_stream class. It reads and writes primitives and primitive
structures to files.

\code
@DOCCODE_FILE_STREAM@
\endcode

The main methods of interest are \ref tpie::file_stream::open(),
\ref tpie::file_stream::close(), \ref tpie::file_stream::read(),
\ref tpie::file_stream::write(), \ref tpie::file_stream::seek().

By default, \ref tpie::file_stream reads and writes blocks of size 2 MB at a
time. You can change this by passing a block factor to the constructor of
file_stream.

TPIE file streams keep track of whether files have been closed \em cleanly, i.e.
that a file_stream with write access to a file has been given the opportunity to
close it properly. If a file is not closed properly, e.g. your program crashes
while still having the stream open, then you will have to manually delete the
stream files.
